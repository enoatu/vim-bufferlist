VIM bufferlist
==============

This Repository was forked from [roblillack/vim-bufferlist](https://github.com/roblillack/vim-bufferlist)

Additional features
============
1. **Sort Buffer**
  - This buffer plugin sorts the files in the buffer by file or directory name.
You will be able to find the desired file easily.
2. **Improve Style**
  - If you have written "set list" to vimrc, you will be annoyed by the style in the buffer.
This solves this problem.
3. **Speedy deletion**
  - The cursor position after deleting the buffer has been moved to a place where it can be easily deleted again.
